## What is Collaborative Notepad?
Imagine a magical place where you can write notes, share them with friends, and edit them together in real-time‚Äîwithout the risk of losing your precious thoughts! That's right! The **Collaborative Notepad** is an online tool that allows multiple users to collaborate on notes simultaneously. Think Google Docs but for your random musings and grocery lists.

## Why Did We Build This?
Because we can! And also because:
- **Collaboration**: Teamwork makes the dream work (or at least makes note-taking less boring).
- **Real-time Editing**: Forget about emailing drafts back and forth like it‚Äôs 1999.
- **Unique URLs**: Each note gets its own unique URL, so you can feel special (and maybe a little bit like a web developer).

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you‚Äôll need a few things:
1. A computer (preferably one that works).
2. An internet connection (unless you enjoy staring at error messages).
3. Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (or at least a willingness to learn).

## How It Works
The **Collaborative Notepad** uses some cool technologies to make everything happen:
- **Node.js**: The server-side superhero that handles requests and manages connections.
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js that makes routing as easy as pie (or cake, if you prefer).
- **Socket.IO**: The magic that allows real-time communication between users‚Äîlike instant messaging but for notes!
- **MongoDB**: Our trusty database where all your notes are stored safely (we hope).

## Features
Here are some features that will make you say ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù:
- Create new notes with unique URLs.
- Edit notes in real-time with friends.
- Set custom URLs for your notes.
- Responsive design that looks good on any device (even your grandma's old tablet).

## Technologies Used
This project is built using:
- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **Socket.IO**
- **MongoDB**
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**

## Installation Steps
Ready to roll? Here‚Äôs how to set it up:

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sh13y/collaborative-notepad.git
cd collaborative-notepad
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set Up MongoDB**
- Create a MongoDB database (you can use MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting).
- Add your MongoDB URI to a `.env` file in the root directory:
  ```env
  MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here
  ```

4. **Start the Server**
```bash
npm start
```

Your server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Create a new note or enter a custom URL.
3. Invite your friends to join by sharing the URL.
4. Start typing away while pretending to be productive!
